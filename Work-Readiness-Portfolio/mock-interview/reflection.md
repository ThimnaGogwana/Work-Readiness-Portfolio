# Mock Interview Reflection

**Evidence:** Mock Interview Feedback Document  

**Situation:**  
A mock interview was conducted to simulate a real-world job interview experience.

**Task:**  
My objective was to demonstrate professionalism, confidence, and knowledge of the ICT field.

**Action:**  
I dressed appropriately, maintained eye contact, and structured my answers using STAR. I also handled feedback positively.

**Result:**  
The feedback highlighted strong communication but suggested I elaborate more on technical examples. I plan to practice more scenario-based responses.
