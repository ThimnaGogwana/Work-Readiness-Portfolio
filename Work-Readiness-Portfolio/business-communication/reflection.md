# Business Communication Reflection

**Evidence:**  
1. Professional Email to Lecturer Regarding Grade Discrepancy  
2. Presentation Slides on "Effective Communication in the Workplace"  

---

**Situation:**  
During the Work Readiness module, I had to prepare and send a professional email to my lecturer to address a grade discrepancy I noticed between my Blackboard Gradebook and the SOS system for my subject (PRP370S). At the same time, I worked on a presentation about effective communication in the workplace.

**Task:**  
The goal was to demonstrate professionalism in written communication by addressing an academic concern respectfully and clearly, and to deliver an informative presentation that showcased the importance of communication skills in the workplace.

**Action:**  
In the email, I used a polite and formal tone to outline the issue, provided context, and attached supporting screenshots for clarity. I ensured my language was concise, respectful, and solution-oriented.  
For the presentation, I applied PowerPoint design principles, used structured slides with visuals, and practiced my verbal delivery to ensure I communicated confidently and effectively.

**Result:**  
My lecturer appreciated the clarity and professionalism of my email and was able to confirm and resolve the marks issue quickly. The presentation was also well received, highlighting the importance of communication in professional settings.  
Through this experience, I learned how effective, respectful, and well-structured communication — both written and verbal — can resolve issues efficiently and enhance professional relationships.
